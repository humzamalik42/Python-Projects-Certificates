Gender Discrimination Experiment on Facebook Marketplace

Project Overview

This project investigates potential gender discrimination in seller responses on Facebook Marketplace. By utilizing a set of six fictitious buyer profiles (three male and three female), the study examines whether sellers respond differently to male and female buyers.

How Python Was Used

Python was leveraged to automate key processes and ensure unbiased data collection, showcasing advanced proficiency in the language:

Profile Matching: Automated the random selection and confirmation of buyer profiles using Python.

Web Scraping: Utilized Selenium and BeautifulSoup to log in to Facebook and scrape Marketplace data for products within a 40 km radius and priced under 10 dollars.

Data Management: Combined and filtered data to meet specified criteria, ensuring accuracy and relevance.

Interactive Validation: Included user confirmation steps to validate profile selections and product listings.

Recording Transactions: Meticulously recorded transaction details such as delivery times, product quality, and seller responsiveness in Google Sheets and Excel.

Key Features

Automated Data Collection: Python scripts automated the matching of buyer profiles with sellers and the scraping of product data from Facebook Marketplace.

Data Accuracy: Ensured 100% data accuracy and integrity through systematic data management and interactive validation.

Policy Implications: The findings can inform policy discussions on e-commerce regulations, gender equality, and consumer protection.
