Python Proficiency

Overview:

My GitHub repository showcases extensive Python proficiency through projects like "Investigating Netflix Movies," "Exploring NYC Public School Test Result Scores," "Modeling Car Insurance Claim Outcomes," and "Gender Discrimination Experiment on Facebook Marketplace."

These projects demonstrate my capability to leverage Pythonâ€™s powerful libraries and tools to derive insights from real-world data sets.

Projects Description:

Investigating Netflix Movies:

Objective: Analyze movie trends from the Netflix dataset focusing on the 1990s era.

Techniques Used:

Data Filtering: Utilized Pandas for complex filtering operations to isolate movies from the 1990s and specific genres.

Mode Calculation: Employed statistical functions to determine the most frequent movie duration, showcasing my ability to apply statistical methods in Python.

String Operations: Leveraged string methods to filter data based on genre content, demonstrating proficiency in handling textual data.

Exploring NYC Public School Test Result Scores:

Objective: Analyze SAT scores across NYC schools to uncover educational insights.

Techniques Used:

Data Aggregation and Transformation: Used Pandas to create new variables, aggregate data, and compute school-level statistics.

Advanced Sorting and Filtering: Demonstrated advanced data manipulation skills by sorting and filtering schools based on performance metrics.

GroupBy Operations: Showcased the ability to group data by categorical variables and compute summary statistics, critical for data-driven decision-making in educational contexts.

Predicting Car Insurance Claims:

Objective: Predict whether a customer will file a car insurance claim based on various features.

Techniques Used:

Data Exploration: Loaded and examined the dataset for data types, missing values, and distributions.

Data Cleaning: Filled missing values using the median and corrected any typos in column names.

Feature Encoding: Converted categorical variables to numeric using LabelEncoder.

Model Building: Built logistic regression models for each feature and calculated their accuracy.

Performance Measurement: Identified "driving experience" as the most predictive feature with an accuracy of 0.7771.

Gender Discrimination Experiment on Facebook Marketplace:

Objective: Investigate potential gender discrimination in seller responses on Facebook Marketplace.

Techniques Used:

Profile Matching: Automated the selection and confirmation of 100+ buyer profiles using Python.

Web Scraping: Utilized Selenium and BeautifulSoup to log in to Facebook and scrape Marketplace data for products within a 40 km radius and priced under 10 dollars.

Data Management: Combined and filtered data to meet specified criteria, ensuring accuracy and relevance.

Interactive Validation: Included user confirmation steps to validate profile selections and product listings.

Recording Transactions: Meticulously recorded transaction details such as delivery times, product quality, and seller responsiveness in Google Sheets and Excel.

Skills Demonstrated:

Data Manipulation: Mastery in using Pandas for data cleaning, filtering, and transformation, essential for preparing data for analysis.

Statistical Analysis: Proficient in applying statistical functions to analyze data distributions and identify key trends.

Machine Learning: Demonstrated ability to build and evaluate logistic regression models for predictive analysis.

Web Scraping and Automation: Utilized Selenium and BeautifulSoup for automated data collection from web sources.

Efficient Code Practices: Code snippets reveal an organized and efficient coding style, emphasizing readability and functionality.

Interactive Validation: Ensured data integrity through interactive validation steps, maintaining high standards of accuracy.
